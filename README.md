## _Notice:_
_!! In the latest version the code as .exe gets detected by MSDefender!! Use an earlier commit or wait to bypass that_

_The Code is still in the Beta, i started making it like 1 day before i uploaded it here._

_The Code is pretty unreadable bcs everything is one file. Thats on purpose bcs i dont want to have the pain with multiple Files in PyInstaller. I wont add a Builder or something because then tooo skiddy people are gonna use it_

_Please help me by contributing more Features and reporting issues and improvements._
